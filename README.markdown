# Faster Integer Parsing

This repository is a collection of my experiments and benchmarks for integer
parsing. The accompanying article can be [found on my
website](https://kholdstare.github.io/technical/2020/05/26/faster-integer-parsing.html).

From discussions on reddit, it turns out someone else has stumbled on the exact
same ideas before me, Wojciech Mu≈Ça. You can find his [articles on the subject
here](http://0x80.pl/articles/simd-parsing-int-sequences.html).
